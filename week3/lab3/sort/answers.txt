sort1 uses: selection sort
- random: 7.788s
- reversed: 5.783s
- sorted: 0.351s

How do you know?: random is time-consuming, but sorted is fast

sort2 uses: merge sort
- random: 0.469s
- reversed: 0.395s
- sorted: 0.559s

How do you know?: in general, the most efficient algorithms, if we compare them with the other two

sort3 uses: bubble sort
- random: 3.197s
- reversed: 3.214s
- sorted: 3.006s

How do you know?: something between the first and second algorithm so should be a bubble sort
